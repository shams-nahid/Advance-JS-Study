### Dynamic vs Static Type Language

- Dynamic Typed Language
  - In Dynamic typed language, we do not explicitly say the type of object, like integer, string etc. We can use generic type `var`, `const`, `let` etc.
- Static Typed Language
  - In static typed language, we have to explicitly say the type of object.
  - Advantages are, self documented.

### Weekly vs Strongly Typed

In JS,

```js
1 + '1';
```

result `11`.

This is weakly typed.
