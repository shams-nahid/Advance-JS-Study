## Lexical Environment

- Lexical environment is a place where we write code
- Every time we create an execution context, code inside these contexts are under a lexical environment
- When we do the `lexical analysis`, it find the work or token location or which context it belongs to
- We can consider lexical environment as a planet for execution context
- Lexical environment determine the access of the methods and objects
- The first lexical environment is the global execution context
